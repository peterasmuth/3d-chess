# 3d-chess

I want to make a Python based 3-dimensional chess game. I want to experiment with a variety of ways to display the state of the game to make it playable. In the end, I hope to have something I can host online and have other people play (Potentially a Flask app?).

## Potential Views
- Click-and-Drag 3d orbit view
-- Highlight possible moves for a piece
- Vertical/Horizontal cross-section views

## Background

- Possible rule sets for 3d chess: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_chess
- Existing Python chess library: https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
